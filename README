JTurMachine

A Turing Machine simulator, written in Java.
########################################################################
Currently, JTurMachine can certainly run Turing Machine programs which
start with a blank tape, e.g. busy beavers. Creating a machine with a
non-blank tape has not been tested.

USAGE:

The only way to run a program at the moment is with a Java class, as can
be seen in src/TuringMachineTest.java.

TODO:

- Fix the creation of machines with a non-blank tape.
- Decide on notation for programming a machine.
- Read and execute programs from a file.
- Improve the way in which the contents of a tape are printed.

Eclipse project files are included.
